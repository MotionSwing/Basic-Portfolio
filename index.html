				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<img class="profile" src="assets/images/profile.jpg" title="Sipping on some coconut" alt="Jon White drinking out of a coconut" />
				<p>This is me sipping out of a coconut in the Philippines. I enjoy traveling, drawing and coding. I'm determined to improve my skills in web design so that I can build fully interactive dynamic web applications with ease.</p>
				<br />
				<p>I want to be a part of the push towards automation so that we can focus more time and attention to the things that truly matter. I've been programming on and off in Java and Visual Basic for the better part of 15 years now, mostly as just a hobbyist. The world of coding has greatly changed since I first started (back when frames were more prevalent than CSS).</p>
				<br />
				<p>I'm looking forward to learning more and eventually working as a freelance full-stack developer.</p>
